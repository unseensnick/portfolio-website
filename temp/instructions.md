I have a PayloadCMS collection defined in `@src\collections\Portfolio.ts`. I want you to review its structure and create a plan for how to make the collection easier and less tedious to work with in the admin panel. Don’t generate the final code yet — just analyze and outline improvements.

## Context

- Some sections are **verbose or repetitive** (lots of similar text/media fields).
- **Field order isn’t always intuitive**. For example, in the **projects section**, the `viewMoreText` field shows up near the top, but it would make more sense right before the `viewAllLink` field.

## Requirements

1. Identify the **tedious or confusing patterns** in the current schema.
2. Propose different ways the schema could be restructured or reorganized to improve the editing experience.
3. Provide **critical feedback** on both my observations and your own suggestions — including pros, cons, potential problems, and how realistic each change would be to implement in PayloadCMS.
4. Call out any **blind spots or missed opportunities** I may not have considered.
5. Summarize the overall trade-offs so I can decide which changes are worth making.

Use the PayloadCMS docs (`@docs\payloadCMS\`) as reference for best practices. Once the plan is clear, I’ll ask you to generate the updated code.
